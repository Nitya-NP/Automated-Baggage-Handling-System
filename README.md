# Automated-Baggage-Handling-System
This project is a group effort aimed at designing and simulating an automated baggage handling system to improve efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and reliability in air travel. With the increasing demand for global air travel, baggage handling has become a critical bottleneckâ€”leading to delays, higher costs, and lost luggage.

Our solution combines software, CAD design, and QARM simulations to create a system that can:
- Reduce lost baggage incidents.
- Improve boarding efficiency by streamlining baggage flow.
- Lower operational costs through energy-efficient automation.

This project was developed as a group project during my first year of engineering as a course work. 

  # Features
  - Automated baggage transport system to reduce errors in handling.
  - Software-driven simulation of baggage flow (major contribution).
  - CAD design for system modeling (partial contribution).
  - QARM testing to validate efficiency and reliability.
